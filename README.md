## React App for Web Api Challenge Stretch Goal

challenge repo can be found here: https://github.com/rupol/webapi-challenge/blob/master/README.md

## Stretch Goal

- Use `create-react-app` to create an application in a separate folder (outside the API project folder). Name it anything you want.
- From the React application show a list of all _projects_ using the API you built.
- Add functionality to show the details of a project, including its actions, when clicking a project name in the list. Use React Router to navigate to a separate route to show the project details.
- Add styling!
